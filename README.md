This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.3.0.

## How to contribute

Take a careful look at style variables and global utility classes in styles.css. Our goal is to build a good application while keeping our code clear, so:

#### • Never repeat yourself

If you have to, make a new utility class for team reusability. Feel free to refactor anything as long as you're making the code more legible.

#### • Keep to the Pattern

A good front-end application might look as if it were built by one single person. That means everyone keeps the same pattern while developing components.

#### • Try to Avoid Magic Numbers
Sometimes it can't be helped, but for most cases, it's totally reasonable. To maintain standardization while setting CSS sizes, give preference to the use of multiple values or divisors of 4 (0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.8,..., 4, 8, 12,...).

#### • Focus on Functionality
Design is definitely a concern, but not as high and costly as functionality. We must focus on delivering functional components, adjusting the visual part of the application is a quicker and easier job. Make sure it's simple.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component components\component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
